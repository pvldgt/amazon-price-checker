AMAZON PRICE CHECKER 

This is an educational project that I completed within Day 47 of this course https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code

The script parses the desired Amazon product page, looks for the product price, and then 
sends an email alert if the product price is lower than the set target price.
